## Description

The project is about a game involving two players who go head on and gives the results in the end.
When the user clicks the start button it directs him/her to the page with the game. In the game when the roll button is clicked, the dice is rolled and a number is generated between numbers 1-6. If one is returned, an alert is displayed and it becomes the turn of the other user. Points are then displayed in the points per round and when it is the other persons turn, the total points are displayed in the Total score. The first player to reach 100, that is the one whose total score adds up to 100 an alert is displayed that that person is the winner.
